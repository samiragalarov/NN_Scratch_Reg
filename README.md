## Description

This repository contains a Python implementation of a neural network with options for various settings, including the number of hidden layers, regularization techniques (L1, dropout), learning rate, and more. The neural network is designed for training on a given dataset for various tasks such as classification.

## Usage

To use this neural network implementation, you need to include the `NN` function in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook. The function takes several parameters, which are explained in the next section.

## Parameters

The `NN` function takes the following parameters:

- `X` (array-like): The input data of shape `(n_x, m)` where `n_x` is the number of input features, and `m` is the number of training examples.
- `Y` (array-like): The target output data of shape `(n_y, m)` where `n_y` is the number of output classes.
- `iter` (int, optional): The number of iterations for training the neural network (default is 150).
- `l1_reg` (bool, optional): Enable L1 regularization (default is False).
- `dropout` (bool, optional): Enable dropout regularization (default is False).
- `lr` (float, optional): The learning rate for gradient descent (default is 0.01).
- `lm` (float, optional): Lambda parameter for regularization (default is 0.7).
- `num_hidden` (int, optional): The number of hidden units in the neural network (default is 1000).
- `keep_rate` (float, optional): The dropout keep rate (default is 0.85).

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `NN` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define your input and target data
X = np.array(...)  # Shape (n_x, m)
Y = np.array(...)  # Shape (n_y, m)

# Call the NN function with your desired settings
result = NN(X, Y, iter=200, l1_reg=True, dropout=True, lr=0.01, lm=0.5, num_hidden=500, keep_rate=0.9)

# The result contains the trained parameters (weights and biases)
[w1, b1, w2, b2] = result
